    "# Getting AQI Data\n",

    "Next, I need to get the AQI data For the city of Philadelphia to do further analysis for this, I will be using the aqs.epa.gob website to get the data. AQI stands for Air quality index, Which is a measure of how clean or polluted air is. Since different pollutants have different kind of impact on the environment and air quality the QA is used as a standardized way to measure the quality of air irrespective of the pollutant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AQI Score is divided into multiple parts:\n",
    "- 0-50: Good\n",
    "- 51-100: Moderate\n",
    "- 101-150: Unhealthy for sensitive groups\n",
    "- 151-200: Unhealthy\n",
    "- 201-300: Very Unhealthy\n",
    "- 301-500: Hazardous\n",
